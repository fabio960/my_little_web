      <h2>A <i>happy</i> DAY</h2>
      <p>In many ways, SUNDAYS are sucks.
      <br> If I were working in a n offcie somewhere, it would have been my last day of weekend.
      <br> but even if I don't, still it's a day I need to spend with my family in a boring Starbucks.
      <h5>in that way, I'd rather say today fees like a Saturday or even vacation</h5></p>

        <h5>I recommend to go there in weekdays cos it's super nice <u>without people</u></h5>
        Vienna coffee looks nice (and the cream does) but I think filter is nicer.
        <br>that prosciutto toast is yummy!

        <h5>damm, I even wrote a review while I was eating!</h5>
        GET dancing sala mandu. Get it 5 times cos it so nice.
        <br>taco tastes in a juicy mandu.
        <br>the noodle has a strong spicy and thick paste.
        <br><i>Different to any type of cold spicy noodle.</i>
